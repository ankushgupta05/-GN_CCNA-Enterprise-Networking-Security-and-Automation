**Explanation:**
Multiple OSPF areas **limit the scope of SPF recalculations** and **reduce the size of the LSDB**, improving **performance and scalability**.

---

### **Question 12**

**At which OSPF state are neighbor routers converged and able to exchange routing updates?**

ðŸ”˜ Two-Way
ðŸ”˜ ExStart
ðŸ”˜ Exchange
âœ… **Full**

**âœ… Correct Answer: Full**

**Explanation:**
Routers reach the **Full state** when they have **synchronized LSDBs** and are **fully converged**. This is when routing updates can be exchanged.

### **Question 13**

**The OSPF hello timer has been set to 15 seconds on a router in a point-to-point network. By default, what is the dead interval on this router?**

ðŸ”˜ 15 seconds
ðŸ”˜ 30 seconds
ðŸ”˜ 45 seconds
âœ… **60 seconds**

**âœ… Correct Answer: 60 seconds**

**Explanation:**
The **default dead interval** in OSPF is **4 times the hello interval**. So, with a 15-second hello, the dead interval is **15 Ã— 4 = 60 seconds**.

### **Question 14**

**What happens immediately after two OSPF routers have exchanged hello packets and have formed a neighbor adjacency?**

ðŸ”˜ They exchange DBD packets in order to advertise parameters such as hello and dead intervals.

ðŸ”˜ They request more information about their databases.
âœ… **They exchange abbreviated lists of their LSDBs.**

**âœ… Correct Answer: They exchange abbreviated lists of their LSDBs.**

**Explanation:**
Once routers form an adjacency, they exchange **Database Description (DBD) packets**, which are **abbreviated LSDB summaries**.

---

### **Question 15**

ðŸ”˜ OSPF can consolidate a fragmented OSPF area into one large area.
ðŸ”˜ All routers are in one area called the backbone area (area 0).
